# CassandraApi

A simple REST api with Elixir, Phoenix Framework, and Cassandra.

Docker compose file is used to bring up a cassandra container with port 9042 exposed.

Run the following command to start up cassandra:

`docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up`

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4001`](http://localhost:4001) from your browser.
